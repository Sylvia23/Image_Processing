Computer Vision

First of all you should know the basic syntax of Python.
To start with computer vision you need to have a basic knowledge about Deep Learning, neural neworks, CNN , RCNN , fast RCNN , faster RCNN.

Here are some resourses,

	Deep learning, CNN (Startup)

Step1:

	Lets start with making GUI for the neural networks.
	For this install OpenCV in Ubuntu.
	Refer to this documentation for installation : http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html
	
	The repository contains an example of a neural network made with OpenCV called "OpenCVRedEye" which 
	-converts the img into gray scale, 
	-splits and merge the image into BGR components, 
	-puts boxes one eyes, puts text on the image, 
	-save the given image in a different format eg.png.
